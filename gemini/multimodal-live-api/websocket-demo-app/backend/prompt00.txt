I want to use Cursor to help me implement the Gemini Multimodal Live API demo application from Google.

Here's the link to the tutorial: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai/tree/main/gemini/multimodal-live-api/websocket-demo-app

I have already cloned their repo to 

My goal is to learn how to use the Gemini Multimodal Live API by working through this tutorial.

Please provide guidance and code suggestions to help me follow the tutorial effectively.

Here are some general guidelines:

* Focus on Python implementation where possible.
* Help me set up the project structure and necessary files.
* Guide me through the steps of installing dependencies and configuring the environment.
* Assist me in understanding the code and how it works.
* Provide code snippets and explanations as needed.
* Help me troubleshoot any issues I encounter.

By the end of this, I should have a working implementation of the Gemini Multimodal Live API
that I can use as a starting point for my own projects. And I should have a version hooked to Vertex AI to use.
